In 2016, I participated in a 9 month long Fulbright research project in the Kingdom of Eswatini, where I conducted anthropological research on adolescent HIV care with the Baylor International Pediatrics AIDS Initiative. This blog represents a collection of posts written during that time covering my experiences of local politics, youth culture, and the privilege of travel.
